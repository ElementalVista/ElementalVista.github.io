<h3>Enhancement One: Software Engineering and Design</h3>

<p>I used OpenGL and GLFWto create the graphics. I also used both 2D and 3D techniques, especially by adding a skybox with texture mapping. On top of that, I organized the program using object-oriented programming with classes to keep things structured and easier to manage. At first, I learned how a basic game loop works, how to use C++ classes to organize code, and how to use OpenGL to draw things on the screen. When I added new features, I learned how to bring in an outside library (stb_image.h) to load image files, and how to set up textures in OpenGL, loading the image, creating a texture, connecting it to the right shapes, and making sure everything drew in the right order. For example, I had to make sure the skybox drew first so it stayed in the background. The hardest part was setting up the project to find and use outside tools like GLFW. I had to fix errors about missing files and libraries, which meant checking the project settings carefully. I also ran into trouble with texture loading and sometimes the screen would just go black or white. I had to check if the image files were in the right place, make sure the names were typed correctly, and confirm the images were in a format OpenGL could use. It taught me a lot about solving problems while the program is running.

This artifact is a "Task Manager" application I built in Java for my data structures course. Its purpose is to manage a list of tasks.
I chose this project because it was a great foundation for improvement. It originally used only a HashMap to store tasks, which was fast but couldn't prioritize them. I improved it by adding a priority field to the Task class and then integrating a PriorityQueue into the TaskService. This enhancement automatically keeps tasks sorted by importance, showing I can select the correct data structure to add a critical feature.
I applied a key data structure (the PriorityQueue) to solve a real-world problem, and it forced me to evaluate code efficiency—understanding the performance trade-offs between the HashMap and the PriorityQueue.
The biggest challenge was keeping the HashMap and the PriorityQueue perfectly synchronized, especially when handling deletions. This process taught me a valuable lesson in careful data management and how to correctly combine the strengths of different data structures to build a better application.

<p>This project is an interactive website for viewing and searching animal shelter data. I chose it for my portfolio because it shows my ability to build a complete data-focused application, from the database all the way to the user's screen. The project demonstrates several key skills. The main.py file shows how I use Python for database tasks, while the dashboard file proves I can create a user-friendly website with charts and maps. I improved the application by moving data filtering to the database to make it much faster. I also added a reusable search function and a safety log to track all data changes.
This work helped me meet my course goal of getting better with advanced database tools. I learned that having the database do more work is key to making an application faster. The biggest challenge was setting up the database correctly for the data tracking feature, which was a great lesson in how systems are put together and the importance of reading instructions.

<h3>Professional Assessment</h3>

<p>My college courses and the work I've put into this portfolio have helped me turn classroom knowledge into real-world skills for a career in computer science. I’ve learned how to build software from the ground up, like my C++ graphics project where I had to manage all the technical details myself. I also know how to create full applications, like the animal shelter website, and make them run faster by having the database do more of the heavy lifting. I’m not just focused on building things, but on building them the right way, like when I improved my Java Task Manager by using a better data structure to handle task priority. Beyond my solo projects, I’ve learned how to work well on a team using tools like Git, how to keep security in mind to protect data, and how to clearly explain my work to others. All this has prepared me to be a valuable and effective member of a professional team.</p>
<p>
The three projects I’ve included here are meant to give you a clear picture of my abilities. The first is my 3D graphics program, which shows how I can handle complex technical challenges and organize code using object-oriented programming. The second is the Task Manager, which proves I can analyze a problem and pick the right tool to add an important feature and make the program more efficient. Lastly, the animal shelter website demonstrates my ability to build a complete, user-friendly application, from managing the data in the background to creating the charts and maps you see on the screen. Together, these projects show the full range of my skills, from problem-solving to building complete software.
