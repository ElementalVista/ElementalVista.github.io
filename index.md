This artifact is a "Task Manager" application I built in Java for my data structures course. Its purpose is to manage a list of tasks.
I chose this project because it was a great foundation for improvement. It originally used only a HashMap to store tasks, which was fast but couldn't prioritize them. I improved it by adding a priority field to the Task class and then integrating a PriorityQueue into the TaskService. This enhancement automatically keeps tasks sorted by importance, showing I can select the correct data structure to add a critical feature.
I applied a key data structure (the PriorityQueue) to solve a real-world problem, and it forced me to evaluate code efficiencyâ€”understanding the performance trade-offs between the HashMap and the PriorityQueue.
The biggest challenge was keeping the HashMap and the PriorityQueue perfectly synchronized, especially when handling deletions. This process taught me a valuable lesson in careful data management and how to correctly combine the strengths of different data structures to build a better application.

<p>This project is an interactive website for viewing and searching animal shelter data. I chose it for my portfolio because it shows my ability to build a complete data-focused application, from the database all the way to the user's screen. The project demonstrates several key skills. The main.py file shows how I use Python for database tasks, while the dashboard file proves I can create a user-friendly website with charts and maps. I improved the application by moving data filtering to the database to make it much faster. I also added a reusable search function and a safety log to track all data changes.
This work helped me meet my course goal of getting better with advanced database tools. I learned that having the database do more work is key to making an application faster. The biggest challenge was setting up the database correctly for the data tracking feature, which was a great lesson in how systems are put together and the importance of reading instructions.
